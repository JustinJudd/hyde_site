Previously I covered [setting up a Linux Development Server][] and how
to [increase Trac Functionality][]. This Post I would like to focus on
customizing the look of Trac in order to blend it into your site. You
can see on of my [Trac projects][], and [Pidgin][] is also a good
example.

Project List
------------

If you have been following my previous posts, you should see a list of
all of the Trac projects you have created when you go to [IP address or
domain]/projects

This page is really boring by default, but we can create a custom
project listing page to match the other pages of a site. First we will
need to create a file to list the projects. Create this file with the
following commands.

    cd /var/www/
    sudo touch project_list.html

Open this project\_list.html with your favorite text editor. Wrap these
following lines of code within your default page code

    <!-- primary content -->
              <div class="primary-content">
                <div class="blocks">
                  <div>
                  <h1>Available Projects</h1>
                <ul>
                  <p py:for="project in projects" py:choose=""﻿﻿﻿﻿>                <a py:when="project.href" title="$project.description" href="$project.href"><img src="$project.href/chrome/$project.env.project_icon" alt="" height="25" /> $project.name </a>
                    <p>   $project.description</p>
                    <py:otherwise>
                      <small>$project.name: <em>Error</em> <br /> ($project.description)</small>

                    </py:otherwise>                
                  </p>
                </ul>
                  </div>
                  </div>
              </div>          <!-- /primary content -->

That code loops through all of the projects, grabs the icon associated
with the project and then grabs the project name and turns it into a
link. It then grabs and displays the project description. You can modify
this as desired by playing around with the $project values. [This
page][] can give you some ideas of project data you might be able to
grab

Now we need to add this next line to our
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default in the <Location /projects\>
section that we added before.

    PythonOption TracEnvIndexTemplate /var/www/project_list.html

Now restart the apache server with the following command.

    sudo service apache2 restart 

Now when you visit [IP address or domain]/projects you should be
presented with your new custom project list.

Project Pages
-------------

The files you will need to change to modify the look of the Trac project
are site.html in the templates directory within the Trac project
directory and style.css in the htdocs directory. In our example we would
modify site.html in /var/lib/trac/project1/termplates and style.css in
/var/lib/trac/project1/htdocs. Full information about these
customizations can be found [here][], but I will outline the highlights
below.

First, if you are using the custom style.css, you will need at least the
following and then fill in the rest as needed.

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:py="http://genshi.edgewall.org/"<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
          xmlns:py="http://genshi.edgewall.org/"
          py:strip="">  <!--! Add extra style sheets or javascript here -->
      <head py:match="head" py:attrs="select('@*')">
        ${select('*|comment()|text()')}

        <!--! This will reference your htdocs/style.css file -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
              href="${href.chrome('site/style.css')}" />
      </head>  <body py:match="body" py:attrs="select('@*')">
        <!--! Add site-specific header -->
        <div id="siteheader">
          <!--! Place your header content here... -->
        </div>    ${select('*|text()')}    <!--! Add site-specific footer -->
        <div id="sitefooter">
          <!--! Place your footer content here... -->
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>

The style.css file is just a regular style sheet and doesn't have any
special rules or templating issues for trac. You can see how my project
pages have the same look and style as the rest of my site at [this
example][]. I have also found the following references that might help
out.
