Previously I outlined my [development server setup][], and now I thought
that I would outline the setup for my client development environment. I
use [Eclipse][] for my primary IDE because of all the functionality you
can add through different plugins and extensions. You can set it up so
that you can do almost everything in your development process within
Eclipse, and it is also platform independent, so you can use it on
Linux, MacOSX or Windows. You can check out a lot of the available
extensions with the new [Eclipse Marketplace][].

One of the most important plugins that I use is [subclipse][], which
allows you to pull in projects from subversion and manage subversion
repositories. A lot of projects use SVN as their code repo base, so this
plugin allows an easy way to grab, modify and commit the code. Another
svn plugin for Eclipse(which I don't have as much experience with) is
[subversive][], which supplies similar functionality.

The next Eclipse add-on I use is so that I can view, create and manage
Trac tickets from within Eclipse. This plugin is the [Mylyn Trac
Connector][]. You can create custom queries so that you can manage
different lists of tasks. The other great thing about this plugin is
that you can enable automatic synchronization so that you can have
offline access to project tickets. You can also set it up to use the
XML-RPC connector which we set up [earlier][].

One of the most compelling reasons to use Eclipse as your IDE
environment is the support of [Google][] for Eclipse. If you want to
develop applications for [Android][], or develop good cloud web-apps,
Google has released great tools that integrate into Eclipse. For Android
development, they have the [Android Development Tools][] that allows you
to set up what version of Android you want to develop for, helps
automatically manage and build your projects and libraries, run and
debug in an android emulator or connected devices, and you can also
export your Android application installer(apks).

If you develop web sites, then [Google Plugin for Eclipse][] will help
you take advantage of Google's APIs and Google's Web Toolkit.

Eclipse can support a large number of languages. Depending on which base
installation of Eclipse you have, it may come with support for any of
Java, C, and C++. Another language that I have used extensively is
Python. [PyDev][] is a great addition to Eclipse to provide more
functionality for python projects, and has some cool features like code
completion and analysis.

Speaking of code analysis, another plugin I use is the [Checkstyle
plugin][]. [Checkstyle][] is a Java code analyzing tool. You can set
filters and style guides, and Checkstyle will make sure that those
guides and rules are being followed.

For those of you that like to tweak the visuals, you might enjoy
[Eclipse Color Theme][], that lets you choose between a number of
different editor color schemes and themes. Through [their site][] you
can also get additional themes and even create your own.

Eclipse is a wonderful development environment that by itself provides a
lot of functionality, but becomes an indispensable tool when coupled
with the large number of excellent plugins. Feel free to check out some
of the other top plugins, and feel free to comment and let me know if I
am missing one of your favorite Eclipse plugins.
