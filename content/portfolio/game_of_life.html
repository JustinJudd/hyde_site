{% mark excerpt -%}
I completed this project with Phil Lundrigan as a team assignment for the Digital System Design class.  
{%- endmark %}
Our implementation of he Game of Life is a simulation of life that abides by the following rules
<table border="10" align="center"><td>
	<ul style="text-align:left;"><li>If less than 2 neighboring pixels are alive, the pixel dies</li>
	<li>If more than 3 neighboring pixels are alive, the pixel dies</li>
	<li>If 3 neighboring pixels are alive, a dead pixel will come back to life</li></ul></td></table>


We implemented an LFSR to create a random game board with random colors. 
Using the VGA controller and block memory we display the game board and write to it depending on certain rules.
The user can control how dense the game board is populated, what colors are displayed, and how fast the simulation goes.
