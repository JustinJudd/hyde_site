I have been working on a game for Android based on the board game
[Mastermind][]. It has the classic mode, as well as a few other
variants. I have attached some screenshots below.

It is in a near finished state, I would just like to get some people to
play around and test it for me. If you have an android device, please
[download the beta version of the app][]. Please let me know if you have
any problems or if you have any suggestions by [submitting a ticket][].
