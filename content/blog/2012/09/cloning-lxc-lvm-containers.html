After a hiatus from blogging, I am back at it. I recently found out
about Linux Containers(LXC)[[LXC - Sourceforge][sourceforge]]. Linux
Containers are very similar to FreeBSD jails or Solaris Zones. They
allow virtualization using a shared kernel, which means that there is
very little overhead compared to other virtualization options.

With LXC, you can use Linux's Logical Volume
Management(LVM)[[LVM HOWTO][lvm_howto]]. LVM allows you to
do things like change partition size as neeed, make snapshots of a
partition, do hot-swapping with multiple drives, or software RAID
capabilities. In particular for this article, I am going to focus on the
LVM Snapshot feature.

LVM Snapshots use a technique called copy-onwrite, so when you create a
snapshot of a logical volume, LVM doesn't copy all the data from the
logical volume into the snapshot, but rather LVM creates a mapping of
deltas, or changes that have happened to the inital logical volume, and
then in essence unplays those in the snapshot. Everytime you make a
change to the original logical volume, it gets written to the original
volume, and then to each snapshot. Original LVM Snapshots were read
only, and were initially created so that you could back up your main
logical volume from the snapshot, knowing that the snapshot wouldn't
have changes happening to it while you were making a backup of it. With
the current version of LVM, Snapshots are now Read-Write This means that
you can treat LVM snapshots as a full working copy of the original
logical volume, but you will still have the performance hit of writing
to the snapshot and the original logical volume everytime a change in
the original volume is made.

Using LVM as the container for your LXC instances allows you to do
immediate cloning, as it creates an LVM snapshot. This is great for
instances where your original logical volume won't change much, but if
both the snapshot and original volume are in active use, you will get
hit with writing to the Snapshot whenever either change. Unfortunately
with the current implementation of LXC clonging when using an LVM base
is that it only supports snapshotting of the original volume, and not a
true clone. You can get this same outcome with just a few extra steps
though(Warning, the following commands assume knowledge of LXC and LVM
commands).

    lxc-start -n brushfireapps_dev -d
    #Create a snapshot clone of the LXC lxc-clone -s -L 3G -o original -n original_copy

    #These commands are to set up the static IP address I want used in the LXC

    vim /var/lib/lxc/original_copy/config 

    mkdir /mnt/lvm_fs

    mount /dev/lxc/original_copy /mnt/lvm_fs/

    vim /mnt/lvm_fs/etc/network/interfaces 

    umount /mnt/lvm_fs/

    #Set up LXC to start on system boot

    ln -s /var/lib/lxc/original_copy/config /etc/lxc/auto/original_copy

    #Create a full Logical Volume that you will copy the snapshot data to.

    lvcreate --size 3GB --name original_copy_tmp lxc # 3GB was the size of my initial lv

    dd if=/dev/lxc/original_copy of=/dev/lxc/original_copy_tmp # can also do this over the network "dd if=/dev/lxc/original_copy | pv -ptrb | ssh user@hostname of=/dev/lxc/original_copy_tmp "(Thanks to https://github.com/mpalmer/lvmsync )

    #Switch the names and clean up the snapshot

    lvrename /dev/lxc/original_copy /dev/lxc/original_copy_old

    lvrename /dev/lxc/original_copy_tmp /dev/lxc/original_copy

    #Start your LXC using the full new Logical Volume

    lxc-start -n original_copy -d

Let ne know if there are any cool tips or tricks you know with LXC or
LVM.
