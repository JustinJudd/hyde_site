This is a project that is currently in development.  I am developing this Android App with my friend Spencer Griffin.  We noticed that there were not any great IM apps in the Android Marketplace, so we have set out to create our own.  
		
I have focused on everything that the user interfaces with, ranging from the look of the actual app and screens, to the notifications delivered when a chat message is received.

The most dificult part of this project so far, has been coordinating with Spencer who has been living in North Carolina.  I have set up a server with a Subversion repository so that we can easily share code and keep track of changes.  I also added Trac to the server so that we can make goals and create tasks that progress towards those goals.  This integrates with the subversion repository, so we can see what changes complete or address the appropriate tasks.
