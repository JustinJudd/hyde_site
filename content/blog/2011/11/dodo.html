So I have been working on an Instant Messaging App for Android called
[Dodo][] with my friend [Spencer Griffin][] for the past while. We are
pleased to announce that it is now available on the [Android
Market][Dodo].

It currently supports XMPP and works with Google Talk and Facebook Chat,
as well as custom XMPP/Jabber servers. We have plans to include support
in the future for AIM, MSN Messenger as well as Yahoo Messenger. If you
have an Android device, please check out [Dodo][]. We appreciate
feedback, fea﻿ture requests and notification of any errors or problems,
which you can post on our [project page][] or [email us][].﻿﻿

Check out Screenshots of [Dodo][] in action below.



Also, stay tuned for updates and new projects here, as well as on the
site for our new venture, [BrushFire Apps][].
