{% mark excerpt -%}
This is part 2 of setting up a Linux Development Server like I have
done(can be seen [here][]). Recently I wrote a post on setting up a
Linux Server to use in development environments which you can read
[here][Linux Development Server - Apache SVN]. This time I would like to highlight a few of the changes that
I have made to Trac to add additional functionality to it, many of which
can be seen [here][]. Most of these settings can be changed through the
Trac Admin page, especially the Plugin part, which is accessed from
being logged in, and then Admin-\>Plugins. Mine looks like the
following.




You can install plugins from the right-hand form on this page, and
manage installed plugins from the center section.

SVN Hooks
---------

SVN hooks allow you to control Trac tickets from within your subversion
commit messages. In order to use this we will need to copy SVN hooks
plugin and configure it.(You can also get a copy of it [here][Trac Commit Hooks])

Continuing with the example from my previous post with the svn and trac
*project1*, we would run the following commands

    sudo cp /usr/share/doc/trac/contrib/trac-post-commit-hook /usr/share/trac/contrib/
    cd /var/svn/project1/hooks
    sudo touch post-commit
    sudo chmod 755 post-commit

Now we will need to edit the post commit file using your favorite text
editor. These are the contents of my post-commit file.

    #!/bin/sh
    REPOS="$1"
    REV="$2"
    LOG=`svnlook log -r $REV $REPOS`
    AUTHOR=`svnlook author -r $REV $REPOS`
    TRAC_ENV='/var/lib/trac/project1'echo "Writing revision " $REV >  tmplog.txt/usr/bin/python /usr/share/trac/contrib/trac-post-commit.py   
    -p "$TRAC_ENV"    
    -r "$REV"         
    -u "$AUTHOR"      
    -m "$LOG"sudo svn update /var/lib/trac/project1/doxygen/src/
    sudo doxygen /var/lib/trac/project1/doxygen/project1

Now you should be able to reference and close tickets in your subversion
commit statements.

Example commit messages can be seen [here(closes)][] and
[here(reference)][].
