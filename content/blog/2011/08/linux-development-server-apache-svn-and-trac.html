{% mark excerpt -%}
I have a development server set up so that I can back up my code and
colloborate with others on code, similar to Google Code, but self
hosted. You can see an example by clicking on any of these [projects][projects].
It is set up using apache as the webserver, SVN for the code
repository, and Trac for the wiki, source management frontend. Trac is
extremely expandable and customizable and is used by a number of
projects such as [Pidgin][Pidgin]. I will highlight my trac modifications in
my next post.


In this post I will highlight installing and setting up all of the
needed components on a Debian system.

Install Programs
----------------

    sudo apt-get install apache2 subversion trac python-setuptools libapache2-mod-python enscript

SVN Configuration
-----------------

First we will need to create a repository for a project. Let's say that
we want the project and repository to be called project1. Run these
following commands to create the repository with the proper permissions

    cd /var
    sudo mkdir svn
    sudo svnadmin create /var/svn/project1
    sudo chmod -R www-data svn

Trac Configuration
------------------

Now we will need to create the corresponding trac project by entering
the following commands. Keep in mind the location of the subversion
repository

    cd /var/lib
    sudo mkdir trac
    sudo trac-admin project1 initenv
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data project1

You will then want to add ad administrative user to the trac project. We
will create and add a user *root* to our project1 with the following

    sudo trac-admin project1 permission add root TRAC_ADMIN 

Now we will need to tie a password to the user that Trac can use. We
will set the password for the root user to passwd123 with the following
command.

    sudo htpasswd -cb /etc/apache2/passwords root passwd123

Apache Configuration
--------------------

Now we need to tell Apache about the trac project so that it can serve
the pages and handle authentication. You can do this by adding the
following lines to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

            <Location /projects>
                 SetHandler mod_python
                 PythonInterpreter main_interpreter
                 PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend
                 PythonOption TracUriRoot /projects
                 PythonOption TracEnvParentDir /var/lib/trac
            </Location>

           <Location "/projects/[^/]+/login">
                 AuthType       Basic       
                 AuthName       "Dummy Project trac"
                 AuthUserFile   /var/etc/passwords      
                 Require        valid-user
            </Location>

Now we will just need to restart apache with the following command

    sudo service apache2 restart

Now you should have a basic development server ready to go. I will show
you soon how to really get the most out of your trac setup.
